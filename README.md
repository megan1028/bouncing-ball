# bouncing-ball
TBB

Implement the 2D bouncing balls simulation using Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB). Specifically do the following:
• Develop the TBB program using appropriate generic parallel algorithms to implement the concurrent computation threads and other TBB constructs to implement the control thread from Assignment 1.
• Implement the required OpenGL calls within your TBB program appropriately.
• Optimize your TBB program to minimize/avoid synchronization as much as possible.
