# bouncing-ball
TBB<br/>

Implement the 2D bouncing balls simulation using Intel Threading Building Blocks (TBB). Specifically do the following:<br/>
• Develop the TBB program using appropriate generic parallel algorithms to implement the concurrent computation threads and other TBB constructs to implement the control thread.<br/>
• Implement the required OpenGL calls within the TBB program appropriately.<br/>
• Optimize the TBB program to minimize/avoid synchronization as much as possible.
